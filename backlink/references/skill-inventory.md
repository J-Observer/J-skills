│   └── harvest.browser.js          generic virtual-scroll table extractor: rebuilds rows
│                                   by Y-coordinate clustering, adapts to column drift.
│                                   NOTE the dot — the harvest-* glob above does NOT match it.
│                                   NOT the first choice any more: scripts/ground-truth.mjs
│                                   pierces shadow DOM, finds the inner scroll container,
│                                   and pairs every read with a screenshot. Come here only
│                                   when you need a whole table exported as a file.
